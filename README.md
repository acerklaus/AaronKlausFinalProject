This application is a game where I am using google maps to show a random city, and the user has to guess the city to score a point. 

I originally was going to create a map for ranking restaraunts and finding places to eat, however I found that was a mostly saturated application type with yelp and open table reviews. 

I decided to go with this because really what I wanted to explore was implementing the Google Maps API for android, and how to play with that to create a user experience which I believe I did here.
