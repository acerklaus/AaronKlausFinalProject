This application is a game where I am using google maps to show a random city, and the user has to guess the city to score a point. 

I originally was going to create a map for ranking restaraunts and finding places to eat, however I found that was a mostly saturated application type with yelp and open table reviews. 

I decided to go with this because really what I wanted to explore was implementing the Google Maps API for android, and how to play with that to create a user experience which I believe I did here. 

Important! I have added the google API Key as a secret so that I do not have that leaked, if this is an issue or is needed please reach out to me and I can resolve this some way, see secret being injected in the adroidManifest.xml file
